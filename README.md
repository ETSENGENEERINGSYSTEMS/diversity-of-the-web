# Diversity of the Web

## Update
In preparation for BADCamp and the collection of data, we're freezing all contributions to the survey on October 17, 2016.  If you'd like to make changes to the survey, we'd love to talk with you about it before then.  

## A discussion about diversity in the web-development community

An initiative to survey, understand, and evangelize the diversity of the web 
development community.  Our goal is to celebrate our diversity, increase 
visibility about existing under-representation, and encourage conversations 
about diversity and inclusion.
