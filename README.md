# Diversity of the Web

## Update
In preparation for BADCamp and the collection of data, we're freezing all contributions to the survey on October 17, 2016.  If you'd like to make changes to the survey, we'd love to talk with you about it before then.  

## A discussion about diversity in the web-development community

An initiative to publish information, raw data, and insights on the diversity
of the web world based on a community-drafted survey, hoping to increase
visibility about existing under-representation and encourage conversations about
increasing diversity.
