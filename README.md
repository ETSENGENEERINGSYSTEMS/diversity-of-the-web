# Diversity in the Web Development Community
An initiative to publish information, raw data, and insights on the diversity
of the web world based on a community-drafted survey, hoping to increase
visibility existing under-representation and encourage conversations about
increasing diversity.

Authored by the community, at
https://github.com/drnikki/diversity-survey

## Timeline
Here's what we're hoping to do:

* May '16: Organize
* June '16: Draft and release survey
* July '16: Wait for results, promote
* August '16: Collect results, publish, event to analyze
* September '16: DrupalCon Dublin: Presentation

## Survey Participants:
Anyone who identifies with ‘moving the web forward’ or ‘making the internet’
Roles like: sysadmin, project manager, shop owner, designer, UX, etc.
Possible problems: skewing the data with ‘content editors’ or ‘copywriters’

## Data Integrity Concerns:
We're hoping to get 10,000 unique responses.

We hope to reduce the number of duplicate survey entries from the same
indvidual (hopefully the survey provider can handle this).

## Methods
* Draft Survey
* Put Survey structure on github for collaboration
* Look at similar surveys from government, other industries,
* Get feedback, particularly on if the questions are good, i.e. not ‘leading’ and questions which are not binary have the right input options
* Should we model survey structure after existing survey - like census
* Run Survey, probably for ~ 1 month
* Collection method, tbd. Google forms can export straight to csv.
* Publish Results
* CSVs on github
* Analyze Results
* Present at DrupalCon Dublin
* (possibly) Propose recommendations for Drupal Association

## Potential Allies
* Jesse Beach:  Facebook, former Druplista
* Blackmesh: Cathy Theys
* Fureigh: 18F, Drupalista
* Pantheon (Nick Stielau)
* Academic qualitative researchers (Nikki to contact)

## Potential Comparisons
* Web vs. ‘Tech’
* Web vs. Fortune 50
* Small vs. Large

## Simple ways to Fail:
* Not doing it at all
* No one is leading/driving it

## How to Contribute
* Fork and PR!
* Contact @drnikki or @nstielau

## Oops! / Ouch! Policy
Talking about diversity can be hard, but we believe talking is first step for
improvement.  As such, we need some room to make mistakes, and to give clear
feedback when a discussion/approach/idea/term is hurtful.  Say 'Oops!' if you
catch yourself on potentially offensive territory, and 'Ouch!' if you feel
offended.  Thanks!

## Next Steps:
* Find survey drafters and reviewers
* Find organizations that will distribute to their mailing lists
* June 15, 4pm PST next meeting.
