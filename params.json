Policy\r\nTalking about diversity can be hard, but we believe talking is first step for\r\nimprovement.  As such, we need some room to make mistakes, and to give clear\r\nfeedback when a discussion/approach/idea/term is hurtful.  Say 'Oops!' if you\r\ncatch yourself on potentially offensive territory, and 'Ouch!' if you feel\r\noffended.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n* http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/\r\n* http://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/\r\n* [Berkeley Diversity Survey Questions](http://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Appendix_A.pdf)\r\n* [Society for Human Resources Management Diversity Survey Questions](https://www.shrm.org/templatestools/samples/hrforms/pages/diversitysurveys.aspx)\r\n",
