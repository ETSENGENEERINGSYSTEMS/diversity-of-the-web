## Stub for survey questions.  

There will probably  be some options for response, i.e paragraph, yes/no,
etc.

We want to do some research on making good survey questions, and what other
surveys are out there that we can learn from.
 
## Survey
A first pass at survey categories and areas about which we want to obtain information.

### Gender Identification
Allowing people to check all labels with which they identify would be good.

### Age
Do we want to collect anything other than an age range (like under 18, 18-24, 25-30, etc.)

### Racial Identification
Allowing people to check all labels with which they identify would be good.

### Position
Should we allow people to choose all labels which describe their job, or limit them to n?

### Location
Do we want people to share their locations?
